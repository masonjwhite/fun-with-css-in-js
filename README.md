This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Motivation

This repository is a part of my "fun with" series. Each and every day I challenge myself to learn something new. Once I feel like I understand a subject well enough to move onto the next one, I build a small proof of concept or example so that I can reference it in the future.

## Structure

This project was bootstrapped with create-react-app. It contains a simple application to fetch data from an API and display that data to the user. All styles are implemented with [styled components](https://www.npmjs.com/package/styled-components).

## Starting the project

1. Clone the repository
2. Navigate to the cloned project and run `npm install`
3. To start the project, run `npm start` to run the app in development mode.
4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

## TODO

- No further development is planned at this time.
